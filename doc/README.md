There is also an example binary compiled to test the library in your platform, it is called `usbbt`.
The `usbbt` executable allows you to list available devices and to send them a reset command.


## Plaform quirks

In Windows you may have to install WinUSB driver in your device using Zadig. Otherwise, UsbBluetooth may not be able to take control of your device.

This library has been programmed in C. You can find information on how to compile, install and use it in the [C API document](API_C.md).

You can also find documentation for the [Python API](API_Python.md) or the [C# API](API_CSharp.md).
